# Dimensionality Reduction

When working with machine learning algorithms, often you will encounter high-dimensional data that can be tricky to work with or understand. Dimensionality reduction methods can be used to reduce the dimensions of the data while maintaining the most important patterns and information that the data contains. Reducing the dimensions of the data can 

improve the performance of the model
make data easier to visualize
improve computational efficiency
help with feature engineering
