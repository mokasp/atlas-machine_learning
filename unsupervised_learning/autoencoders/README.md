## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various types of autoencoders using TensorFlow. Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature learning. The network consists of two main parts:

#### Encoder: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
#### Decoder: Reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.

Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models and can be used for tasks such as data compression, denoising, and generating new data samples. The types of autoencoders included in this repository are:

- Vanilla Autoencoder
- Sparse Autoencoder
- Convolutional Autoencoder
- Variational Autoencoder
## Types of Autoencoders
### Vanilla Autoencoder
Vanilla autoencoders are the simplest form of autoencoders. They consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space), and the decoder reconstructs the original data from this representation. Vanilla autoencoders are typically used for dimensionality reduction and denoising.

### Sparse Autoencoder
Sparse autoencoders introduce a sparsity constraint on the hidden units to force the model to learn a compressed representation of the data. This is achieved by adding a sparsity penalty to the loss function, encouraging the network to activate only a small number of neurons. Sparse autoencoders are useful for feature extraction and unsupervised learning tasks.

### Convolutional Autoencoder
Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) use convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers to encode and decode the data. This makes them particularly suitable for image data, as they can capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns. CAEs are often used for image compression, denoising, and feature learning.

### Variational Autoencoder
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are generative models that learn the distribution of the data and can generate new samples from this distribution. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs encode the input data as a distribution over the latent space rather than a fixed vector. This allows for better generative capabilities and smooth interpolation between data points. VAEs are widely used in generative tasks such as image and text generation.
