def viterbi(Observation, Emission, Transition, Initial):
    """ function that calculates the most likely sequence of hidden states for a Hidden Markov Model using the Viterbi algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Observation : numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (T,) containing the index of the observation.
        Emission : numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (N, M) containing emission probabilities.
            Emission[i, j] is the probability of observing j given the
            hidden state i.
        Transition : numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (N, N) containing transition probabilities.
            Transition[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from
            hidden state i to j.
        Initial : numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (N, 1) containing the probability of starting
            in a particular hidden state.

        Returns
        -------
        path : list or None
            A list of length T containing the most likely sequence of
            hidden states.
            None on failure.
        P : float or None
            The probability of obtaining the path sequence.
            None on failure.
